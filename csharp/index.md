# Introduction to C\#

C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, open-source, high-level, general-pupose programming language developed by Microsoft. It is statically typed and object oriented. It was first introduced in 2000 as part of the .NET initiative and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

## Key principles and features

- **Object-oriented**: C# is fundamentally object-oriented, making use of classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism for clear and reusable code.
- **Multi-paradigm**: In addition to object-oriented programming, C# supports imperative, declarative, generic, functional, and component-oriented programming.
- **Strongly and statically typed**: Code in C# is checked for type safety at compile time, reducing many programming errors.
- **Versatile applications**: C# is widely used for developing desktop applications, web applications, web services, games (especially with Unity), VR, mobile apps (with Xamarin/.NET MAUI), IoT solutions, and database-driven applications.
- **Cross-platform support**: With .NET Core and .NET 5+, C# code can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Automatic memory management**: Managed by the Common Language Runtime (CLR), C# handles garbage collection and memory safety for developers.

C#â€™s syntax is rooted in the C family, making it familiar to those who have used C, C++, or Java. As of August 2025, the most current stable version is C# 13, released in 2024.
