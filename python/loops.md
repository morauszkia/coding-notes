# Loops

We use loops in programming, to run commands repeatedly. There are two types of loops in Python: `for` loops for when we know, how many times we want to run a block of code, and `while` loops for when we don't know in advance, how many times a block of code will run, but we want to run it while a condition is true.

## For loops

## While loops

## Pass

Code blocks of lops (and conditional statements, and function bodies) cannot be empty. If we for any reason (for example, we want to implement something later) want to leave a block empty, we can use the `pass` keyword.

```python
for item in my_list:
    pass

while condition:
    pass
```
