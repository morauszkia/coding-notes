# Python

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and versatility.
It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python was designed to emphasize code clarity and reduce the complexity of programming tasks. Python has consistently ranked among the most popular programming languages worldwide.
The current version is Python 3, which introduced significant improvements compared to Python 2.

## Key features

- **Interpreted language**: code is executed line by line, which facilitates rapid development and debugging
- **Dinamically typed**: variable types are determined at runtime, allowing for flexible and concise code
- **Strongly typed**: values need to be explicitly converted to other types, and are not coerced automatically such as in JavaScript
- **Multi-Paradigm**: Python supports object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming styles, making it adaptable to various types of projects and developer preferences
- **Readability and Simplicity**: Pythonâ€™s syntax is designed to be clean and easy to read, often resembling the English language. Indentation is used to define code blocks, which enforces readability and consistent formatting
- **Extensive Standard Library**: Python is often described as a "batteries included" language because of its comprehensive standard library, which provides tools suited for many tasks out of the box.
- **Cross-Platform**: Python runs on all major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, and is freely available as open-source software.

## Common uses

- Web Development: Used to build server-side web applications
- Software Development: Powers everything from simple scripts to large-scale applications
- Data Science and Machine Learning: Widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence due to powerful libraries and frameworks
- Automation and Scripting: Automates repetitive tasks and system scripting
- Mathematics and Scientific Computing: Handles complex mathematical computations and big data processing

## Installation and usage

Python3 can be installed to the computer, and after that can be used from the terminal with the command `python3 filename.py`. You can enter interactive mode by typing `python` or `python3`, which starts the Python shell, where you can type and execute Python commands.

```bash
python3 --version
python3 main.py
```

You can also use IDEs to run Python files, and to code in Python. Popular IDEs for Python Development are PyCharm, Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebook (especially for data science).
