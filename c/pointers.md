# Pointers

**Variables** are _named references_ to some data in memory.
**Memory** is a big _array of bytes_, in which data is stored.
A **memory address** is an index into the big array of bytes. It is just a large number, written in _hexadecimal_ format.
A **Pointer** is just a _variable_ that stores a memory address.

In C you can use the address-of-operator `&` to access the memory address that a variable is pointing to. You can print memory addresses with the `%p` format specifier.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int age = 37;
  // [!code highlight]
  printf("The address of age is: %p\n", &age);
  return 0;
}
```

You can create a pointer using `*` after the type.

```c
int age = 37;
int *pointer_to_age = &age;
```

## Virtual Memory

There might be exceptions, but most of the time your code does not have direct access to the actual physical memory, but the OS provides access to a layer of abstraction called virtual memory. The OS manages the access to the physical memory (the RAM sticks in the computer). The running program becomes a process and is given access to a chunk of virtual memory.

This has several benefits like

- isolation: one process can't access the memory of another process
- security: the OS can prevent access to certain parts of the memory
- simplicity: developers don't have to think about managing physical memory and the memory of other processes
- performance: the OS can optimize memory access depending on the hardware and the needs of the program

Everything said above stands for virtual memory: it is a large array of bytes, where each byte has its memory address.

## Pass by Reference

It is a typical situation that we want to pass a collection of data to a function, and we want the function _to modify_ the data. However, in C, [structs](./structs) are passed _by value_. Therefore, updating a field in the struct does not change the original struct. If we want the change _to persist_ we need to return the new struct from the function, which will be a new copy of the original struct with the updated field value. The address of the struct that wass passed to the function and that was returned from it _is not the same_.

## Dereferencing

If we want to get access to the data the pointer is pointing to, we use the `*` dereferencing operator.

```c
int ageVal = *pointer_to_age;
```

With structs you can use the `->` operator to access the fields of a struct that the pointer references. This dereferences the pointer and accesses the field in one step.

```c
coordinate_t point = {10, 20, 30};
coordinate_t *ptrToPoint = &point;
printf("X: %d\n", ptrToPoint->x); // X: 10
// same as (*ptrToPoint).x
```
