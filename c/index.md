# Introduction to C and C++

C and C++ are closely related general-purpose programming languages.

**C** has been widely used for over 50 years for building operating systems, databases, applications, etc. It was created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972. C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, and it provides low-level access to memory. C supports procedural programming. In spite of its age it is still widely used.

**C++** started as a superset of C, adding [object-oriented programming](../advanced-concepts/oop) features, exception handling, templating and a more extensive standard library. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and published in 1985. It supports both procedural and object-oriented programming. Over the years, both languages have evolved in parallel.

They are distinct from [C#](../csharp), which has similar syntax, but is a high-level, modern, object-oriented and garbage-collected language designed for application development.
