# Networking, Protocols & APIs

This section covers how computers and applications communicate over networks — from the low-level mechanics of data transfer to the high-level design of web APIs.
You’ll find notes on how the web works under the hood (HTTP, DNS, TCP/IP), how modern APIs are structured and consumed (REST, GraphQL, gRPC), and how these layers interact to move data securely and efficiently across systems.

Use these topics to understand:

- How requests and responses travel through the web
- How to design and document APIs for clients and servers
- How to handle authentication, versioning, and performance issues in distributed systems

## Subtopics

- [HTTP & HTTPS](./http)
- REST APIs
- GraphQL
- gRPC & WebSockets
- DNS & TCP/IP
- CORS & Browser Networking
