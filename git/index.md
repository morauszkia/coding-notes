# Introduction to Version Control and Git

## Version Control

Version control systems (VCS) have become indispensable tools in modern software development, enabling teams to track changes, collaborate efficiently, and maintain the integrity of codebases. By providing a historical record of modifications, facilitating parallel development through branching, and offering mechanisms to resolve conflicts, version control underpins both individual productivity and large-scale DevOps workflows.

## Core Concepts

### Repositories and Tracking Changes

A repository serves as the backbone of any VCS, storing the complete history of a project’s files (blobs) and directories (trees). In Git, initializing a repository with `git init` creates a hidden .git directory containing metadata and snapshots of changes. Version control systems track modifications at varying granularities: some monitor file-level changes, while others (like Git) use content-addressable storage to track individual file chunks.

### The Commit Lifecycle

Changes progress through three primary states in Git:

1. Modified: Files altered but not yet marked for inclusion in the next commit.
2. Staged: Changes selected for the next commit via git add.
3. Committed: Changes permanently recorded in the repository with git commit.

Commits create immutable snapshots, each identified by a unique hash (e.g., a1b2c3d). This ensures traceability, as each commit references its predecessor, forming an auditable chain.

### Branching and Merging

Branches enable parallel development by diverging from the main codebase (often called `main` or `master`). In Git, branches are lightweight pointers to commits, allowing developers to experiment without destabilizing the primary branch. Merging integrates changes from one branch into another, with VCS automating conflict resolution where possible. For example, Git’s merge command combines branch histories, while rebase replays changes atop another branch for a linear history.

### Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)

DVCS, exemplified by Git, decentralize repositories, allowing full local copies. This design enhances resilience and performance, as most operations (e.g., committing, branching) occur offline. Collaboration occurs through pushing/pulling changes between repositories, with platforms like GitHub or GitLab facilitating code reviews and CI/CD integration.

## Git

Git is the most popular DVCS. It is open source and free and enjoys cross-platform support. As the most popular VCS, there are plenty of tutorials and resources that teach it. It is easy to learn and is lightning fast. It works locally on your computer, which gives it a huge speed advantage compared to centralized systems. Furthermore, git's branching model makes it stand apart from the competition.
